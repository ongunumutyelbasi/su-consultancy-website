*“…the way we make a living, the jobs we have, and the way our work is rewarded have a tremendous bearing on our lives, making them either exciting and rewarding, or dull and anxious. For that reason alone, anyone in charge of a workplace is obliged to conside the question: How am I contributing to human well-being?” **\-*** **Mihaily Csikszenthmihalyi, Psychologist**

It is undeniable that the people are the most important assets in business management. If you match the right person with the right position, and if you can get people to work for purposes that also honor their personal values, you will always be successful.

Values are important beliefs and ideals that influence an individual’s behaviour, his/her choices which are fulfilling, as well as the way he/she works, relates with others. Discovering and clarifying values will provide the individuals a map to guide them through the decision paths for a purposeful, fulfilling lives. 

Values are not tangible. For instance, a car/having a car is not a value, but what it gives to the individual is: prestige, easiness, power, self-confidence, etc.

Same applies to business organisations. What your company values the most, how you expect and set the relationships with your employees, how you choose and manage your talents, and how you manage your customer/partner/stakeholder/greater community relationships are shaped by your shared values. That is your *culture*! 

Corporate culture is definitely an essential factor for the success or the failure of a business. As the founders or managers of a company, it is important to create a culture that is compatible with the nature of your area of business, and that is in line with the company’s goals and strategies. It is also important to choose and work with people who have the right strengths to contribute to your success. 

Every employee’s individual strengths which are the values in action, his/her intension to learn and change when needed should be suitable with the corporate culture. 

People have different cultural backgrounds coming from their families, schools, professions; they may even be from different countries. That is why intercultural learning/communication is particularly important. Intercultural communication is the ability to express and interpret messages effectively and appropriately in such intercultural environments as workplaces. Both company and the employees should be open to the cultural flexibility, to adapt behaviour and attitude in structured intercultural environments. 

As a conclusion, for a successful business management, being a “learning company” instead of a “judging” one, being aware of values and strengths as a company, and acknowledge the weaknesses are key factors. Choosing the team players in regard to the company culture, honoring their values, acknowledging their strengths are also important. While encouraging each and every employee to improve themselves via a co-active coaching approach and having them to complete each other with their unique strengths as they work together, absolute success will be achieved.
